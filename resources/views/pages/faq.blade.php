                              <p>In addition to full market cover as we tend to purchase large volumes in each development we are able to negotiate for you using the volume of the company (as an when this is possible).</p>
                              <p>Finally, developers are generally not client focussing and require companies like us to go to the market. As such most developers will be unable to offer discounts which we can negotiate, this is because they cannot be seen to be undercutting the market.</p>

We also have many projects which cannot be advertised due to being owned by our clients who are not actively selling but would be open to offers, or it may be properties we are due to release soon or may even be small developements we will sell to existing clients as there is no need to do a lot of marketing (as they will sell immidiately).</p>
